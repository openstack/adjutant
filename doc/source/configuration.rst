Configuring Adjutant
====================

Adjutant is designed to be highly configurable for various needs. The goal
of Adjutant is to provide a variety of common tasks and actions that can
be easily extended or changed based upon the needs of your OpenStack cluster.

For configuration Adjutant uses a library called CONFspirator to define and
register our config values. This makes the app better at processing defaults
and checking the validity of the config.

An example Adjutant config file is found in etc/adjutant.yaml, and a new one
can be generated by running::

    tox -e venv -- adjutant-api exampleconfig --output-file /etc/adjutant/adjutant.yaml

With ``--output-file`` controlling where the file goes. If the file extension
is given as ``toml`` rather than ``yaml``, a toml format config file will be
generated instead.

This example file should be your starting point for configuring the service,
and your core source of documentation for what each config does.

Adjutant will read the file from ``/etc/adjutant/adjutant.yaml`` or
``/etc/adjutant/adjutant.toml``, and if the environment variable
``ADJUTANT_CONFIG_FILE`` is set, will look for the file in the
specified location.

.. note::

    While Adjutant does support toml as a config format, you are likely
    better off sticking with yaml as it may prove easier and more reliable,
    but for those who much prefer an ini type format, that might feel closer.

Configuration options
+++++++++++++++++++++

Django group
------------

The first part of the configuration file contains standard Django settings,
and for the most part the generated example config will explain all the
options.

Identity group
--------------

Are the configs for how Adjutant interacts with Keystone, with the important
ones being as follows:

**adjutant.identity.username_is_email** impacts account creation, and email
modification actions. In the case that it is true, any task passing a username
and email pair, the username will be ignored. This also impacts where emails
are sent to.

**adjutant.identity.auth** Are the credentials that Adjutant uses to talk to
Keystone, and the various other OpenStack services.

**adjutant.identity.role_mapping** defines which roles can modify other roles.
In the default configuration a user who has the role project_mod will not be
able to modify any of the roles for a user with the project_admin role.

API group
---------

Controls which DelegateAPIs are enabled, and what some of their configuration
may be.

Notifications group
-------------------

Default settings around what notifications should do during the task workflows.

Workflow group
--------------

**adjutant.workflow.task_defaults** Represents the default settings for all
tasks unless otherwise overridden for individual tasks in
``adjutant.workflow.tasks``.

Default action settings.
**adjutant.workflow.action_defaults** Are the default settings for each action
and can be overriden on a per task basis via
``adjutant.workflow.tasks.<my_task>.actions``.


Email and notification templates
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Additional templates can be placed in ``/etc/adjutant/templates/`` and will be
loaded in automatically. A plain text template and an HTML template can be
specified separately. The context for this will include the task object and
a dictionary containing the action objects.
