    Quota management can now be disabled for specific regions by setting
    ``quota.services.<region_name>`` to ``[]`` in the configuration.
    This allows additional flexibility in what services are deployed to
    which region.
  - |
    Quota management can now be disabled entirely in Adjutant by setting
    ``quota.services`` to ``{}`` in the configuration, if quota management
    is not required in deployments.
