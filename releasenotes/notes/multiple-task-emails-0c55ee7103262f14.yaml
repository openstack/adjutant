features:
  - |
    Added the ``to`` field to task stage email configurations, for setting
    an arbitrary address to send task stage emails to.
  - |
    Added the ``email_current_user`` field to task stage email configurations,
    for sending task stage emails to the user who initiated the task.
    Set ``email_current_user`` to ``true`` to enable this behaviour.
  - |
    Added the ``from_address`` variable to task stage email template
    contexts, allowing the address the email is being sent from internally
    to be templated in task stage email bodies.
    Note that this is not necessarily the same address that is set in the
    ``From`` header of the email. For that address, use
    ``reply_address`` instead.
  - |
    Added the ``reply_address`` variable to task stage email template
    contexts, allowing the reply-to address sent to the recipient to be
    templated in task stage email bodies.
  - |
    Added the ``email_address`` variable to task stage email template contexts,
    allowing the recipient email address to be templated in task stage email
    bodies.
  - |
    Added the ``email_current_user_address`` variable to task stage email
    template contexts, which exposes the email address of the user that
    initiated the task for use in task stage email templates.
    Note that depending on the task being run this value may not be
    available for use, in which case it will be set to ``None``.
  - |
    Added the ``email_action_addresses`` variable to task stage email
    template contexts, which exposes a dictionary mapping task actions
    to their recipient email addresses for use in task stage email templates.
    Note that depending on the task being run there may not be an email
    address available for certain actions, in which case the dictionary will
    not store a value for those tasks. If no tasks have any recipient email
    addresses, the dictionary will be empty.
  - |
    Multiple emails can now be sent per task stage using the new ``emails``
    configuration field. To send multiple emails per task stage, define a list
    of emails to be sent as ``emails``, with per-email configuration set in
    the list elements. If a value is not set per-email, the value set in the
    stage configuration will be used, and if that is unset, the default value
    will be used.
